Dear friend of OGN,

you are receiving this mail because someone wants to use a Device ID which

This is the current entry in the devices database:
{{ device_claim.device.aircraft_type.name }}
{{ device_claim.device.registration }}
{{ device_claim.device.cn }}

The claimer added following message:
{{ device_claim.message }}

{% if device_claim.submit_email == True -%}
{{ _("The claimer provided his email address so you can directly contact him via email:") }} mailto:{{ device_claim.requester.email }}
{%- endif %}

The reason for the claim could be one of the following:

1. The owner of the device changed. But the entry in the devices database did not change.
In this case: click the link where you AGREE the claim.

2. You made a mistake in the entry and wrote a wrong device id.
In this case: click the link where you AGREE the claim.

3. You are sure that you still own the device and the device id from the entry is correct.
